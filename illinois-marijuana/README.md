# Illinois Cannabis Directory: Digital Portal (2026)

A high-performance, DMOZ-inspired digital archive tracking the industrial giants and boutique wizards of the Illinois cannabis landscape.

## 💾 Visual Identity
- **90s SEO Portal**: High-contrast directory aesthetics inspired by early web portals (DMOZ, Yahoo!, Geocities).
- **Hard-Coded Grid**: A robust, zero-glassmorphism masonry structure using `directory-box` and `directory-header` containers.
- **Color Palette**: Neon Lime (#00FF00) and Hot Pink (#FF00FF) on a high-contrast Black/Retro-Bg backdrop.
- **Low-Fi Fidelity**: Use of mono-spaced system fonts and heavy borders for a nostalgic "database" feel.

## 🛠️ Technological Frequency
- **Core**: React 19 + Vite + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 + Syne/Outfit Typography
- **Verification**: Hybrid Python validator for programmatic enforcement of the "Three Final Laws."
